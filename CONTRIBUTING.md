### Pull Requests

- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
- Make your changes
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass
- Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- VS Code (for development)

### Installation

1. Fork and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sulsira/scratchy.git
   cd scratchy
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the extension:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

### Running the Extension

1. Press `F5` in VS Code to launch a new Extension Development Host window
2. Use `Ctrl+Cmd+N` (or `Ctrl+Alt+N` on Windows/Linux) to test the extension
3. The extension will create scratch files in the development environment

## Making Changes

### Project Structure

```
scratchy/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ extension.ts          # Main extension logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test/                 # Test files
â”œâ”€â”€ media/                    # Extension assets
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json              # Extension manifest
